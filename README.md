Lead Analysis for an independent gaming company:

Heroes of Pymoli: Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 

TASK: generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

RESULTS:

1.  Demographically, the spending player base is predominantly male, and aged 21-24. Because the average female spender will spend more than the average      male, it would serve company profit to attract more female spenders for future growth.  However, the current spender-base is more than %80 male, and it may be wise to capitalize on the present.

2.  The median spender is less than the average, but this difference is well within a standard deviation; the data is minimally skewed towards top spenders.  Thus, in-game marketing should focus on the average spender, and the in-game store should offer only a few luxury items.

3.  The successes of individual in-game items are highly correlated to their popularity.  It would be in the company's best interest to focus efforts on the creation of additional items similar to those that have seen success. Perhaps these items' prices could be raised to give a spike in profits.
